The University Management System (UMS) is a Python-based application designed to manage the various aspects of a university, including colleges, students, and teachers. The system allows the creation of multiple colleges, and within each college, you can add students and teachers, search for them by roll number, and display their information. The program is menu-driven and provides a user-friendly interface to interact with.

This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, and is designed to provide an easily extensible framework for managing university-related data.

Features
The University Management System includes the following functionalities:
Create College: Allows the user to create a new college, checking for duplicate college names.
Add Student: Adds a student to a specific college with details such as roll number, name, and branch.
Add Teacher: Adds a teacher to a specific college with details such as roll number, name, and subject.
Display Students: Displays a list of all students in a specific college, including their roll number, name, and branch.
Display Teachers: Displays a list of all teachers in a specific college, including their roll number, name, and subject.
Search Student: Allows searching for a student by their roll number within a specific college and displays their details if found.
Search Teacher: Allows searching for a teacher by their roll number within a specific college and displays their details if found.
Search College: Allows searching for a college by name and displays information such as the number of students and teachers in that college.
Exit: Option to exit the program.

Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used to implement the system.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The program makes use of classes and inheritance to model the entities of the system, including colleges, students, and teachers.
Command Line Interface (CLI): The program operates via a simple text-based menu where the user can select options to interact with the system.
